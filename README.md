## 📂 Artifact Details

### 1. [CS-210: Programming Languages (C++)](./CS-210)
* **Project Name:** Corner Grocer Item Tracker
* **Focus:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures (STL Maps), and File Input/Output (I/O).
* **Summary:** A console-based item-tracking application that reads purchase records, computes item frequencies using maps for optimized $O(1)$ lookups, generates daily backups, and renders custom text-based histograms.
* **Key Achievements:** Implemented robust OOP principles by encapsulating logic within a clean `GroceryTracker` class, ensuring maintainable, readable, and highly reusable code.
* **Personal Takeaway:** This project taught me how to handle unexpected file I/O errors and optimize memory usage in C++, bridging the gap between theoretical data structures and practical implementation.

### 2. [CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle](./CS-250)
* **Project Name:** SNHU Travel Sprint Review & Retrospective
* **Focus:** Agile Methodologies, Scrum Framework, User Stories, and Sprint Planning.
* **Summary:** A comprehensive professional review and retrospective analysis representing Scrum best practices, team velocity estimation, and user story mapping for the *SNHU Travel* project.
* **Key Achievements:** Practiced transforming customer user needs into structured user stories with concrete acceptance criteria, prioritizing backlogs, and managing team milestones.
* **Personal Takeaway:** Moving beyond just writing code, this experience highlighted the importance of clear communication and structured planning when translating vague client requirements into actionable development tasks.

### 3. [CS-230: Operating Platforms](./CS-230)
* **Project Name:** The Gaming Room Architecture Design
* **Focus:** Cross-Platform Deployment, System Architecture, OS Resource Management.
* **Summary:** A comprehensive software design document detailing the transition of a mobile app to a centralized, cross-platform Linux server environment using RESTful APIs and relational databases.
* **Key Achievements:** Mapped out domain models applying strong inheritance and encapsulation, and formulated scalable deployment solutions.
* **Personal Takeaway:** This project reinforced that understanding the underlying operating system (like memory paging and process management) is just as important for scalable applications as writing the code itself.

### 4. [CS-255: System Analysis and Design](./CS-255)
* **Project Name:** DriverPass System Design Documentation
* **Focus:** Systems Analysis, UML Modeling, Requirements Gathering.
* **Summary:** A system design document for a cloud based driving school scheduling application. Includes Use Case, Activity, Sequence, and Class UML diagrams mapping out the client's architecture.
* **Key Achievements:** Successfully translated raw client requirements into concrete UML architecture that accounts for role based security and scheduling conflict logic.
* **Personal Takeaway:** Validating software design visually through UML before development ensures the final product aligns perfectly with user expectations and prevents costly architectural rewrites.

### 5. [CS-320: Software Testing, Automation and Quality Assurance](./CS-320)
* **Project Name:** Contact Service (Project One) & Testing Summary and Reflection Report (Project Two)
* **Focus:** JUnit Testing, Requirements-Driven Validation, Defensive Design
* **Summary:** A backend contact management service written in Java, validated with JUnit tests covering valid cases, invalid cases, and boundary values. Paired with a summary and reflection report analyzing the testing approach and quality assurance practices.
* **Key Achievements:** Wrote meaningful JUnit tests that prove requirements are enforced (null checks, length limits, duplicate ID rejection), and connected test coverage directly to stated requirements rather than just passing assertions.
* **Personal Takeaway:** Testing must prove required behavior, not just compile and pass. Intentional edge-case testing with invalid inputs produces software that behaves correctly under realistic conditions.

### 6. [CS-305: Software Security](./CS-305)
* **Project Name:** Artemis Financial Secure Software Practices & Verification
* **Focus:** Software Security, Cryptographic Hashing (SHA-256), TLS/HTTPS Configuration, Dependency Vulnerability Auditing
* **Summary:** A security refactoring and vulnerability mitigation project for Artemis Financial. Implemented TLS communications using a PKCS12 keystore, added a SHA-256 data integrity checksum endpoint in Spring Boot, and conducted OWASP Dependency-Check vulnerability assessments.
* **Key Achievements:** Eliminated unencrypted HTTP data transfer by enforcing HTTPS on port 8443, integrated SHA-256 checksum verification to protect financial data integrity, and resolved third-party security vulnerabilities through automated build scans.
* **Personal Takeaway:** Security has to be integrated into each layer of an application, from build dependencies to transport protocols and endpoint logic. Defense in depth ensures that even if one layer fails, client data remains protected.

### 7. [CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms](./CS-300)
* **Project Name:** ABCU Course Advising Assistance Program
* **Focus:** Binary Search Trees (BST), Algorithm Analysis, Big-O Complexity, Input Validation
* **Summary:** An algorithm analysis and C++ course advising system for ABCU. Project One analyzed runtime complexity and memory tradeoffs across Vectors, Hash Tables, and BSTs. Project Two implemented a Binary Search Tree to load courses from CSV, validate prerequisites, search course details, and print an alphanumerically sorted catalog using in-order tree traversal.
* **Key Achievements:** Built a custom Binary Search Tree in C++ with dynamic memory management, implemented two-pass CSV file validation to verify course prerequisites, and eliminated the need for external sorting by leveraging natural tree traversal.
* **Personal Takeaway:** Data structure selection directly dictates application efficiency and simplicity. Choosing a BST allowed efficient $O(\log n)$ searches while making sorted output natural and immediate, avoiding the extra sorting overhead required by vectors or hash tables.
